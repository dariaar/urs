# Student Attendance Record Using QR Code
This application generates a unique QR code for each student, which needs to be scanned upon arrival in the classroom. The QR code contains information about students (name and surname) and timestamp which makes it unique. Once the page is refreshed, the user gets a new QR code. Scanned data is being saved to the database and is available to students and professors for attendance record.
